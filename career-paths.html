				<h3>With a trucking career at Swift, you'll be able to build a solid career with many different opportunities for growth, job stability and financial success.</h3>

				<div class="stack2">
				<strong>Swift Drivers</strong>
				<p>There are a great variety of trucking jobs available at a company as large and diverse as Swift. Dry van, reefers and heavy haul are among the options for company drivers. In addition to what you drive, there are choices as to how you drive. You can drive solo or as part of a team. In fact, Swift currently has over 750 driving teams on the road. Our teams generally run long-haul freight, coast-to-coast or any other load that has to travel 1,000 miles or more. Some of Swift's most successful teams are husbands and wives who enjoy both companionship on the road and tremendous financial rewards.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="stack3">
				<strong>Flatbed Drivers</strong>
				<p>Swift has a growing fleet of over 500 flatbed trucks and over 1,400 trailers, in a variety of trailer configurations, dedicated to our Flatbed Division. This division is becoming an increasingly important part of our overall operations and demands a special kind of driver with skills beyond those of traditional dry van driving. These drivers are required to have the physical abilities to secure and tarp loads. They will also be given extra training in tying down loads.</p>
				</div><!-- end stack3 -->
				
				<div class="stack4">
				<strong>Dedicated Drivers</strong>
				<p>Once you've established yourself as a reliable, safe and courteous truck driver&#8212;generally after at least six months of continuous work&#8212;other opportunities will be open to you. This includes the chance to be part of a "dedicated" fleet. Working on a dedicated fleet allows you to haul loads for the same company (well-respected companies, such as Target, Home Depot and Wal-Mart) on consistent and predictable routes. It also means you'll enjoy consistently more time at home. As you can imagine, such positions are reserved for the top drivers in the fleet.</p>
				</div><!-- end stack4 -->
				
				<div class="stack5">
				<strong>Swift Driving Academy</strong>

				<strong>Being a Mentor</strong>
				<p>A mentor is responsible for working with recent graduates from CDL schools and helping them become capable, confident truck drivers. Student drivers will spend 240 hours behind the wheel on a mentor's truck actually hauling loads, delivering freight and taking care of customers' needs.</p>
				<P>The driver mentor role can be extremely rewarding. Mentors enjoy the satisfaction of knowing that he or she has equipped a new driver to begin an exciting and new career. The mentor will also enjoy increased earnings for taking on this important responsibility.</p>
				<p>At Swift, the position of driver mentor is only open to those drivers who are the best of the best. Prospective mentors must complete an extensive mentor certification program. They must also be patient and possess excellent communication and interpersonal skills.</p>
