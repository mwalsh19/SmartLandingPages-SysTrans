					<h2>There Are No Dead Ends In Our Open Roads.</h2>
					<h3>When you drive for Swift, you’ll be amazed at how far your experience can take you. As an experienced trucker, you’re in a great position to take advantage of the many career opportunities available only at a company like Swift.</h3></p>

					<strong>Drivers</strong>
					<p>There are a great variety of trucking jobs available at a company as large and diverse as Swift. Dry van, reefers and heavy haul are among the options for company drivers. In addition to what you drive, there are choices as to how you drive. You can drive solo or as part of a team. In fact, Swift currently has over 750 driving teams on the road. Some of Swift's most successful teams are husbands and wives who enjoy both companionship on the road and tremendous financial rewards.</p>
					<strong>Dedicated Drivers</strong>
					<p>If you've established yourself as a reliable, safe and courteous truck driver, other opportunities will be open to you. This includes the chance to be part of a "dedicated" fleet. Working on a dedicated fleet allows you to haul loads for the same company (well-respected companies such as Target, Home Depot and Wal-Mart) on consistent and predictable routes. It also means you’ll enjoy consistently more time at home. As you can imagine, such positions are reserved for the top drivers in the fleet.</p>

				<strong>Mentors</strong>
				<p>Truly exceptional drivers can move up to take on the role of <a href="career-paths.html#panel2">mentor</a>. A mentor is responsible for working with recent graduates from CDL schools and helping them become capable, confident truck drivers. <a href="career-paths.html#panel2">Click here</a> to learn more about being a mentor at Swift.</p>
				<strong>Flatbed Drivers</strong>
				<p>Swift has a growing fleet of over 500 flatbed tractors and over 1,400 trailers, in a variety of trailer configurations, dedicated to our Flatbed Division. This division is becoming an increasingly important part of our overall operations and demands a special kind of driver with skills beyond those of traditional dry van driving. These drivers are required to have the physical abilities to secure and tarp loads. They will also be given extra training in tying down loads.</p>
				<strong>Owner Operators</strong>
				<p>Owner operators enjoy the satisfaction of working as a small business owner combined with the freedom of the open road. They can also experience exceptional income potential—into the six figures. Swift offers the freight network, terminal network, miles and service to make your time as an owner operator as profitable and enjoyable as possible. Swift has excellent lease-purchase programs that can get you into the newest Kenworth tractor with a very reasonable investment. Swift offers its owner operators generous discounts on fuel, insurance, tires and service.</p>

				<h3>Because our drivers are the key contributors to our ongoing success, Swift is committed to providing for their success through an excellent compensation and benefits program that rewards excellence and ambition.</h3>
				<strong>Medical</strong>
				<p>Swift offers a PPO plan that permits you to obtain care and service from any provider you choose. However, if you select “in-network” providers, your out-of-pocket expenses will be greatly reduced. Our medical plan also includes some vision coverage.</p>
				<strong>Prescription Drug Coverage</strong>
				<p>Swift offers a "no deductible" Prescription Drug (Rx) Plan. There are several levels of coverage available. For generic drugs, the co-pay is only $10. For brand name drugs, the amount you pay varies by the plan you select and the cost of the drug. Minimum and maximum charges may apply.</p>
				<strong>Dental</strong>
				<p>Taking good care of your health includes taking good care of your teeth and gums. Swift offers you the opportunity to purchase a voluntary Dental Plan, administered by MetLife that provides coverage for dental office visits and procedures, including orthodontia for children age 19 and under.</p>
				<strong>401(k)</strong>
				<p>Swift continues to recognize the efforts you have made to its success and is proud to offer eligible employees a 401(k) plan. The purpose of this plan is to facilitate and assist you in planning for your retirement. Swift will match your contributions dollar-for-dollar, up to 3% of your pay.</p>
				<strong>Life Insurance</strong>
				<p>Swift pays for a basic life insurance plan for all full-time employees. Some coverage is also provided for family members who are enrolled in the family medical plan.</p>
				<strong>Voluntary Benefits</strong>
				<p>Employees may enroll in Supplemental Life Insurance, Disability, Vision, Group Accident, Critical Illness and supplemental Hospital plans.</p>
				<strong>Employee Assistance Program</strong>
				<p>Swift has contracted with ComPsych to provide employees and their families with confidential, compassionate and responsive counseling and referral services (at no cost to you) to offer immediate help in resolving issues, such as marital and family conflict, alcohol and drug abuse, depression, eating disorders, stress and anxiety, grief and loss, and physical abuse.</p>
