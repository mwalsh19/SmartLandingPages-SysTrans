					<h2 title="Swift History">Swift History</h2>
					<h3>Swift Transportation began operations in 1966 by transporting imported steel through the ports of Los Angeles to Arizona, and cotton for export from Arizona through Southern California.</h3>
					<strong>Swift History</strong>
					<p>Jerry Moyes, founder and former president, began with the same entrepreneurial, can-do spirit that is one of Swift's core values today. The original operation was conducted under the name of Common Market. Operating authority was purchased from a descendant of the Swift Meat Packing family, hence, today's name of Swift Transportation. Jerry, along with his father, brother and a partner took on the typical challenges of a start-up business and turned the company into a $25 million organization by 1984. With the passing of Jerry's father, Carl Moyes, Jerry became the sole owner. By 1990, Swift had grown to a $125 million carrier with 800 trucks. Currently, Swift generates approximately $3.2 billion in revenue and operates over 17,000 trucks. Swift's significant revenue growth is attributable to internal growth with existing customers, as well as acquisition. Since 1988, Swift has acquired 11 different motor carriers.</p>
					<p>Swift's terminal network has grown to 37 full service facilities in both the continental United States and Mexico. Swift owns 100% of Trans-Mex, a Nuevo Laredo, Mexico-based carrier. Swift offers border-crossing services at all major Mexican border crossings and also maintains a presence in every Canadian province.</p>
					<p>Swift Transportation had its first public offering in 1990.</p>
