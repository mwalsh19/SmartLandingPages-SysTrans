						<h2>Giving back, one hero at a time.</h2>
						<h3>Swift is offering 1,000 Full Truck Driving Academy Scholarships to Veterans.</h3>
						<p>Swift Transportation Co. Inc. is celebrating the men and women of the armed forces by offering them a new career in trucking. Swift is committed to providing career opportunities for the heroes of our country, by providing 1,000 full scholarships to Veterans to attend a Swift Academy of their choice. The transportation leader is offering full scholarships to veterans with a 1-year commitment, as well as a $1,000 tuition discount to Selective Reserves and National Guard with a 1-year commitment. </p>
						<p>Former military personnel are a great fit for Swift because their values and work ethics align with what the company looks for in quality candidates. </p>
						<p>Through the Swift Veterans Scholarship program, the company hopes to gain long-term, dedicated, and loyal Swift family members that can grow and develop as they help Swift on its continuous journey toward Best-in-Class. While Swift has offered partial scholarships to veterans for several years, this is the first time they are offering full scholarships. </p>
						<p>Upon training, Swift will place trainees either in over-the-road dedicated or regional driving positions. Once an individual gets into the organization and performs effectively, there are opportunities for development into a team driver, dedicated fleet work, and the potential to become a mentor for future new drivers. At Swift, career paths can even lead to office and leadership positions. </p>
						<p>Participants and those eligible must have been separated from service with an honorable discharge or be an active member of the Guard or Reserve to qualify for the Swift Veterans Scholarship Program. Additionally, if a National Guard or Reserve was called to active duty, they will qualify for the full Scholarship (DD-214 required for verification) Swift driving academies are located in Phoenix, AZ; Millington, TN; Corsicana, TX; and Lewiston, ID. </p>

					<h3>Because our drivers are the key contributors to our ongoing success, Swift is committed to providing for their success through an excellent compensation and benefits program that rewards excellence and ambition.</h3>
					<strong>Medical</strong>
					<p>Swift offers a PPO plan that permits you to obtain care and service from any provider you choose. However, if you select "in-network" providers, your out-of-pocket expenses will be greatly reduced. Our medical plan also includes some vision coverage.</p>
					<strong>Prescription Drug Coverage</strong>
					<p>Swift offers a “no deductible” Prescription Drug (Rx) Plan. There are several levels of coverage available. For generic drugs, the co-pay is only $10. For brand name drugs, the amount you pay varies by the plan you select and the cost of the drug. Minimum and maximum charges may apply.</p>
					<strong>Dental</strong>
					<p>Taking good care of your health includes taking good care of your teeth and gums. Swift offers you the opportunity to purchase a voluntary Dental Plan, administered by Cigna that provides coverage for dental office visits and procedures, including orthodontia for children age 19 and under.</p>
					<strong>401(k)</strong>
					<p>Swift continues to recognize the efforts you have made to its success and is proud to offer eligible employees a 401(k) plan. The purpose of this plan is to facilitate and assist you in planning for your retirement. Swift will match your contributions dollar-for-dollar, up to 3% of your pay.</p>
					<strong>Employee Assistance Program</strong>
					<p>Swift has contracted with ComPsych to provide employees and their families with confidential and compassionate and responsive counseling. Also, referral services (at no cost to you) to offer immediate help in resolving issues, such as marital and family conflict, alcohol and drug abuse, depression, eating disorders, stress and anxiety, grief and loss, and physical abuse.</p>
